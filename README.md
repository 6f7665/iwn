# Icy Winds of Nuna
On Greenland in a village your viking group just landed in you learn a plunderer and his companion has taken the chiefs daughter Nuna hostage, he asks you for help to find and defeat the plunderer and free Nuna, as the game progresses you learn that the plunderer previously defended the village in some sort of racketeering and that he tried to buy Nuna 700 billion fake coins, but the cheif refused, mostly because Nuna didn't like him anyway as he had strange yellow and greasy hair, and it was then that the plunderer took Nuna and disappeared. It's now your job to track the plunderer and his companion and see if you can find them and Nuna, legend has it a great chunk of steel gifted from the gods is located somewhere in the land. The steel is said to have been used to forge the very mjolnir itself, it might be a good idea to investigate it before the plunderers companion gets there.
